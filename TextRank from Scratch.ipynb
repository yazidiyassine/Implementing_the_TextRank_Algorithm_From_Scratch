    "TextRank is a popular graph-based algorithm used for automatic text summarization and keyword extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is inspired by the PageRank algorithm used by Google to rank web pages in search results. TextRank represents a document as a graph, where each sentence (or word) is a node, and edges between nodes represent the relationship between sentences (or words). The algorithm assigns scores to each node, representing the importance or centrality of the sentence (or word) in the text."
